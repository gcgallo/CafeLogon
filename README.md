# CafeLogon
Bypass public wifi network splash screens.  
A python script that uses the selenium web driver to automatically complete 
the splash screen forms commonly found at cafes with public wireless networks.
(note: this script was specifically designed for Au Coqulet, a cafe 
frequented by the Code Self Study meetup group, though I'm sure it 
could be adapted for other cafes and networks)
